# Broccoli Documentation  
  
## Intro  
  
This is the Broccoli programming language. The commands are based on the game Robot Turtles (Kickstarter edition).
  
## Syntax  
  
### Commands  
  
Commands follow the following syntax: `<command name>;<newline>`. You may only have one command per line; so the newline is required. You may have one command per line. Do not have a space between `<command name>` and `;`. To fire the turtle's laser, for example the command would be `laser;`.  Valid commands are:

	- `laser;`
	- `function;`*
	- `forward;`
	- `left;`
	- `right;`

  *See also _Functions_
### Functions  
  
Functions are defined as follows:
`function<optional whitespace>{<newline><one or more valid commands, seperated by newlines><newline>}`. Each code file must have zero or one functions. Having multiple results in undefined behavior. Here is an example function, that fires the laser, and then moves forward. A function should be defined prior to its use. Not doing so results in undefined results.
```
function {
    laser;
    forward;
}
```

### Comments
You may comment your code with the traditional syntax of `//<your comment here>` To be more specific, your comment must match this regex: `\/\/[ a-zA-Z0-9]*`. It defines that a comment starts with two slashes, then it may contain any number of spaces, letters (upper-and-lower case), and digits (`0 - 9`). It must span one and only one line.

## Code files

Code files contain: one or more commands, and zero or one function. Do NOT put blank lines in the code; however, a blank line at the end of the code is REQUIRED.

## To-do
- [x] Add walls
- [x] Add functions
- [x] Validate code inside functions
- [x] Add file IO
- [x] Add comments
- [ ] Add ability to fire lasers in all directions
- [x] Add sound effects
- [ ] Add win condition
